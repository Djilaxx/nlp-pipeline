# nlp-pipeline
 training & inference pipeline for different nlp task using pytorch

# NEXT STEPS
* Find a way to integrate feature engineering in dataset function
* Find a way to be able to load different kind of models (with or without tokenizers)
* Create a trainer that can use different kind of data with different kind of models => Different input and output
